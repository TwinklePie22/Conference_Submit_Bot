    "title": "Vitamin Deficiency Detection Using Vision Transformers and Image Processing",
    "abstract": "Vitamin deficiencies pose a major health risk across global populations, particularly where access to medical testing is limited. Traditional diagnostic methods such as blood analysis are effective but often expensive, invasive, and impractical in low- resource settings. This research introduces a computer vision-based approach that leverages Vision Transformers (ViT) to detect nutritional deficiencies using visible symptoms from the eyes, skin, nails, and tongue. The proposed system is built around a hybrid model that combines a pre-trained ViT with a custom lightweight transformer to support multi-label pre- dictionsâ€”allowing the detection of up to two deficiencies per image. Trained on a manually labeled, publicly sourced image dataset, the model employs sigmoid-based outputs and binary cross-entropy loss to identify deficiencies in Vitamins A, B12, C, D, and E. The final ensemble model reached 94% accuracy, with strong scores in all key evaluation metrics. The use of visual tools like ROC curves and confusion matrices helps validate its reliability. Additionally, a user-friendly web interface was created, making it accessible for the public to use without any hassle. Results indicate that ViT-based frameworks can serve as effective, scalable tools for nutritional screening in real-world settings.",
